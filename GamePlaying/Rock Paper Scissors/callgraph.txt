Function Details
* play(player1, player2, num_games): Orchestrates the game loop.
    * Calls the player functions (like quincy(), mrugesh(), etc.) by passing the opponent's previous move.
    * Compares results and prints final scores.
* Bot Strategies:
    * quincy(): Cycles through a predefined list.
    * mrugesh(): Counters the most frequent move in the last 10.
    * abbey(): Predicts based on the last 2 plays and transition likelihood.
    * kris(): Basic counter to opponent’s last move.
    * random_player(): Randomly selects 'R', 'P', or 'S'.
* RPS.player(): Our custom player that adapts to the opponent’s previous move.
* test_module.py:
    * Contains unit tests to ensure our custom player wins at least 60% against each bot.
